\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis is meant as an overview on the computation of backbones of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form, being a problem situated in the domain of SAT solving. An introduction into this general domain is given to allow understanding without deep prior knowledge of the field. Various algorithms, which are grouped into approaches on the problem, are listed and subsequently also methods on how to improve these algorithms. A special emphasis is given on the concept of preferences, where underlying SAT solving algorithms are guided internally in their search to speed up the computation of backbones. Various methods are proposed to resolve performance issues of the preferences approach and subsequently tested on multiple benchmarks of varying difficulty to verify their effectiveness. In closing, using an in-depth analysis of the results, specialized backbone algorithms for some of the same benchmarks are constructed.
