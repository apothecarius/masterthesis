Preferences turn out to be a viable method to calculate the backbone of boolean CNF formulae that are based in a real world application. They can be disadvantageous in certain difficult cases, but it is possible to configure them in a way that they can automatically adapt to these special formulae.

If the particular application allows and calls for it, it makes sense to make an in-depth analysis of the properties that you expect to encounter in the formulae of the application for which you want to compute the backbone. Choosing the right mechanics for the traits of your formula can save a lot of computation time and even creating a specialized algorithm from scratch could give great benefit.

When doing this, it is vital to keep in mind that every applied method not simply means more information and that there is no perfect algorithm to compute a backbone. Every formula is different and could very well not have the property that reacts well with your employed techniques. It might even be that the key lies in only applying them regularly but only once.

 but also more computation time

Guiding the behaviour of the SAT solver using preferences can be very beneficial in the case of real world applications and where it would be disadvantageous, the penalty can be kept under control. 

nicht alles was algorithmisch erlaubt ist, bringt automatisch performance vorteile

die aggressivste methode muss nicht zwangsläufig irgend einen benefit bringen

future work dazu machen
