This thesis is an investigation on the calculation of backbones for boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (or CNF in short). A CNF formula $F$ is a conjunction of a set of clauses $C(F)$, meaning that all of these clauses have to be satisfied (or fulfilled) to satisfy the formula. A clause $c$ in turn is a disjunction of a set of literals, meaning at least one of said literals must be fulfilled. A literal $l$ can be defined as the occurence of a boolean variable $v$ which may or not be negated and to fulfill such a literal, it's variable must be assigned $\bot$ for negated literals and $\top$ for those literals without negation. The same variable can occur in multiple clauses of the same formula but must have the same assignment in all occurences, either $false$ ($\bot$) or $true$ ($\top$). A complete assignment of all variables of $F$ (written as $Var(F)$) that leads to the formula being fulfilled is called a model. A formula for which no model can be found is called unsatisfiable.

The exact terminology can differ depending on the paper and project that you read. A formula can be called a problem and the assignment of a variable can be called it's phase. Clauses can also be called constraints and sometimes sentences. A synonym for a formula, clause or literal being fulfilled is it being satisfied. Models can also be called solutions of formulas

The backbone is a problem specific set of literals that contains all literals that occur in every model of that problem. We can also say that a variable is not part of the backbone, if neither it's positive or it's negative assignment is in the backbone. If we have an unsatisfiable formula, it's backbone can be considered undefinable, which is why this thesis concerns itself only with satisfiable CNF formulas.
